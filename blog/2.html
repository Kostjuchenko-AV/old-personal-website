<h2>Making an iOS app at Midihack</h2>
<p>
My friend Ashok and I were set to attend Midihack this year in Berlin.
For some reason I never made the connection of objective C and C. Objective C seems just like a layer on top of C that allows for a lot of automatic memory management associated with classes and objects.
I found it weird that you had to nil terminate an array [1, 2, 3, 4, nil] etc
I found it interesting that you had to use NS classes for wrappers for primitives like NSString. Haven't had that since Java
Using the xcode interface for programming UI interaction. Ashok said it felt like the UI helped you along a lot, not like eclipse that just feels really clunky
Syntax [dog bark] would call the bark method on the dog object
Debugging and not being able to evaluate local variables
UI programming is a lot different to CSS. Had to use constraints which confused me a bit (was it like this before iPhone introduced different screen sizes?)
Actually felt good to be able to write terrible code - didn't have time to learn how to do a collection view properly so just ended up with a 30 minute copy and paste session. Extremely dirty, but surprisngly fun.
Lots of really good projects. Didn't see a presentation that I thought was shitty (a lot better than the last one)
At the end of the hack I felt a bit guilty that we said we would make a launchpad and raspberry pi sequencer, but pretty happy with the progress we made
Initially was a bit pissed that it was a 'hackathon' and that lots of people already prepared a lot, but really liked the outcome and that people used it to focus on certain areas of their project.
Really loved the workshop, it's great to interact with people that directly make the stuff.
Really want to make a launchpad javascript wrapper now!
Really liked the division of work that I and ashok made. Split up UI and backend and met in the middle, and it just worked!
First time in ages that I've had an mvp earlier than I expected. Could use the last day to focus on polish and jokes :)
The staff changed up the structure from demoing hardware to a one minute presentation, then walk around and try stuff out. Was a lot more efficient than what we saw from the previous midihack.
